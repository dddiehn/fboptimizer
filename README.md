# fboptimizer
long term plans are to allow the user to customize everything they want/don't want to see
So like people who hate seeing sports posts could just put in a list of sports keywords and it'd just delete them
or whatever subject you want...have a checkbox per category (sports, politics, clickbait) and turn them off/on
I've had this idea for like two years but I've never felt like making it. Facebook has been so annoying lately that I've gotten the motivation to start it.
