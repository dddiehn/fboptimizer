###WORK IN PROGRESS
long term plans:
* allow the user to customize everything they want/don't want to see
  * So like people who hate seeing sports posts could just put in a list of sports keywords and it'd just delete them or whatever subject you want...have a checkbox per category (sports, politics, clickbait) and turn them off/on
* we could even go the other way where only posts that contain a list of keywords show up
* integrate a user's friends/liked pages lists so I don't see posts from people not in my immediate network. I don't care that you and matt damon are such great friends and have conversations about things I don't care about
I've had this idea for like two years but I've never felt like making it. Facebook has been so annoying lately that I've gotten the motivation to start it.
